But recently i can't even install it.\n\nThe error logs with `npm install`:\n\n```bash\n  ‼ getaddrinfo ENOENT raw.githubusercontent.com\n  ‼ gifsicle pre-build test failed\n  i compiling from source\n  × Error: Command failed: C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /s /c \"autoreconf -ivf\"\n'autoreconf' �����ڲ����ⲿ���Ҳ���ǿ����еĳ���\n���������ļ���\n```\n\nIn the beginning, i thought the problem is my windows can't run autoconf. So, i tried installing cygwin, And that is difficult for me. I never tried to installed cygwin.\n\nAnyway, i installed successfully. But the problem has not solved. There is still has the errors with npm install .\n\n## imagemin-gifsicle\n\nThe problem appeared when installing gifsicle, The Hexo-all-minifier used it too. So, the best way is go to the gifsicle issues. As predicted, there is someone got the same errors. \n\nBe unexpected, It's not a problem with windows or autoconf. That is network problem🌚. \n\n```bash\n  ‼ getaddrinfo ENOENT raw.githubusercontent.com\n  ‼ gifsicle pre-build test failed\n```\n\nAs in above two lines, the problem is can't connect with `githubusercontent.com`.\n\n## Best way\n\nWrite domain with ip into the hosts. That is best way to connect with github and other domains.\n\n```\n52.74.223.119     github.com\n192.30.253.119    gist.github.com\n54.169.195.247    api.github.com\n185.199.111.153   assets-cdn.github.com\n151.101.76.133    raw.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    gist.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    cloud.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    camo.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    avatars0.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    avatars1.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    avatars2.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    avatars3.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    avatars4.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    avatars5.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    avatars6.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    avatars7.githubusercontent.com\n151.101.76.133    avatars8.githubusercontent.com\n```\n\nThen, try`npm cache clean -f`and`ipconfig/flushdns`.\n\nAs long as can ping with github domains, the problem will be solved.\n\nThe `Command failed` just write some ips for hosts, then `npm install` will be worked.\n\nSo, \n\n![批注 2020-08-04 135700](../images/Can't%20install%20gifsicle/批注%202020-08-04%20135700.webp)\n\n\n\nenjoy it.","desc":"Hexo-all-minifier\n\nIn a long time, i'm used to Hexo-all-minifier to optimization blog.
